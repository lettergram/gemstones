Hackerrank Problem: Gemstones

* Solution in python: Runtime: O(n), Memory: O(n)
* Solution in C: Runtime: O(n + m), n being max, Memory: O(n + m)

The solution in C does not actually work because their compiler doesn't allow calloc (as far as I can tell). Further, the solution in C is not using a hash table, instead using counting sort (which I've been looking for an excuse to use).
